Hi! I'm Caio (pronunciation is close to "Kyle", but not quite). Nice to have you here!

I'm a quantitative researcher based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, with a background in economics, programming and law.
You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/CaioLC), <a href="http://">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://">LinkedIn</a>.
If you prefer email, feel free to reach out at <a href="http://">contact@notkyle.dev</a>.

Here, we'll mostly talk about finance and programming. I'll share my professional insights,
as well as findings from hobby projects (like this dev blog). Whether it's exploring data-driven strategies,
building tools, or learning new skills, we'll document our journey of discovery, 
so that future-me (and future-you?) can follow along for times to come.

Grab a cup of your favorite beverage, and happy reading :)
